## 🎯 **How to Use the Algorithms**
1️⃣ **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Algo_Dij.m)**:  
   - Used to calculate the shortest path between two points in a weighted graph.
   - The user can input a network of nodes and edges with weights.

2️⃣ **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (alg_FF.m)**:  
   - Used to find the maximum flow in a flow network.
   - It computes the maximum possible flow from a source node to a sink node in a graph.

3️⃣ **Visualization (graphique.m)**:  
   - Graphical representation of the networks and the results of optimization algorithms.
